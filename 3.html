      <h3>YOLK meets man behind Global March.</h3>
        <p>YOLK CEO and Solar CowüêÆdesigner Sen met Nobel prize winner Kailash Satyarthi at a forum on ending child labor in the Netherlands.
            Kailash was the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize In 2014, along with Malala Yousafzai,
            for their work against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.
            Kailash spoke at the conference on ‚ÄúTaking next steps to end child labour in global supply chains‚Äù in January 2020.
            The Dutch government convened the event with the International Labor Organization and the Global March against Child Labour,
            which was founded by Kailash in 1998 when thousands of people marched through more than 100 countries for the cause of ending child labor.
           The organisation now runs various programs to tackle child labor around the world.
           Companies met with governments, civil service organizations and employers‚Äô and workers‚Äô organizations to share best practices,
           discuss challenges and lessons learned for better efforts to bring child labour in supply chains to an end.
           Sen explained to Kailash how YOLK‚Äôs Solar Cows can help reduce child labor in developing countries by encouraging families to send kids to class.
           She also met with members of the Global March. YOLK aims to cooperate closely with the Global March, given their mutual aims of improving opportunities
            for children in developing countries.
