      <h3>Innovative tech for a brighter world</h3>
    <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The Solar Cow – one of Time Magazine’s top 100 inventions of 2019 –
       is a solar charging system installed in schools in rural off-grid areas in African countries,
        with a current focus in Tanzania. Solar Cows allow kids to charge portable batteries, called Solar Milk,
         while they attend class and take them home at the end of the school day.
          Each battery is fitted with a light and charging port to act as a power bank for simple devices such as phones and radios at home.
          Many kids are unable to attend school because they have to work to support their families—either by earning an income or helping with household chores.
            – Solar Cows tackle this problem. These batteries are so effective, it’s almost like teleporting kids to school!
